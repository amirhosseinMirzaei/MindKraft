## üì± App Workflow

1. üì§ **Upload a Document**  
   The user uploads a study-related document (e.g. class notes or exam materials).

2. ü§ñ **AI-Powered Analysis**  
   The uploaded file is analyzed using OpenAI's artificial intelligence to extract and understand the key content.

3. üóìÔ∏è **Smart Study Planning**  
   Based on the user's exam date, the app generates a weekly study plan, intelligently organizing the content for efficient learning.
